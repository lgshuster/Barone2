# ECE121 Student Repo  

Welcome to your repo for ECE121. All source code and attending projects should be hosted and worked on in here.
Below you will find descriptions of the folders and their intended use. Feel free to add more but for grading purposes
you must use the directories as described.


*  include: all header files used for the class belong here with subdirectories as needed. It has been seeded with the
current set of includes
*  src: all source files used for the class, both provided and written, belong here. 
*  projects: this folder contains sub-folders for each lab. Your MPLABX projects must reside here if you expect help 
debugging.
Each lab folder also contains a README.md file, we do not grade those, feel free to use them as you see fit.


Occasionally we might need to update the provided files. We will do so by pushing a copy of ECE121.zip to CANVAS.
When that occurs, and we will normally announce it, you will need to download and extract the new copies.
